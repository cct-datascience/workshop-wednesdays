    - *Tools*: RStudio projects

3. **Repeat & reproduce**
    - Learn to repeat coding tasks more effectively and refactor code to be more reusable and reproducible
    - *Tools*: base R
    
4. **Clean & plot**
    - Learn to use tidyverse tools to modify and visualize data
    - *Tools*: dplyr/tidyr/ggplot2

3. **Document & publish**
    - Learn how to write project READMEs and publish reports
    - *Tools*: markdown, Rmarkdown files, RPubs, RStudio Connect, GitHub

### General structure
This workshop was originally taught as a series of 8 two-hour virtual sessions, meeting twice a week for four weeks. We have now added two sessions, such that the workshop series can extend for 8, 9, or 10 sessions.  

Lesson 4 is an optional extension to explore the foundations of collaborating on GitHub, including forking, remotes, and pull requests. Lessons 6 thru 9 are now modular, meaning that they are independent of each other and can be mixed and matched depending on learner interest. 

Relatively small workshop size (< 15) helped keep one-on-one troubleshooting manageable for two instructors. 

The workshop format is primarily code-along, with some sessions that include more discussion and demonstration. We use R/RStudio for the entire workshop. Students should install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) prior to the first class.

![](figures/file-path-example.png)

 - Can also use example diagram for file system using instructor's
![](figures/file-structure-example.png)

#### Teaching notes
- If not already installed, learners should install R and RStudio
- Need to install git initially for Windows users to have shell commands
     - Separate into 2 breakout rooms to install git/GitBash for Windows and Macs
     - Restart RStudio after installation
     - For Windows, open RStudio Tools/Global Options/Terminal and make sure GitBash is selected

- Emphasize purposes for learning shell
     - Helpful for using git and GitHub
     - Easier to deal with installation problems
     - Understanding file structure and file paths
- Unzipping shell-lesson-data.zip through point-and-click in the RStudio Files tab does not work consistently across machines; recommend unzipping on the command line with `unzip`
  - Once unzipped, have everyone share absolute file path to location of file
- If there's additional time, can also cover [Software Carpentry Unix Shell episode #3](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html)

##### Review
Ask students to share their diagram of their file system. Warm up with the review question in slide deck. 

##### Modifications
 - Navigate to `Desktop/` as a consistent location
 - Use `mkdir` to make a new folder and name it `pilot-analyses/`
 - Use RStudio interface to create a new/blank R file (rather than using the planets example)
 - Add R pseudocode or comments to blank R file

#### Teaching notes
 - `pilot-analyses/` will be the locally created repository
 - When setting up git for the first time, remind students to use the same email as their existing GitHub account or to select an email that will be used for GitHub
 - Reinforce using `cd` and `ls -al` to move around the file structure and see contents
 - Show how git restore can be used to undo a saved file
 - HEAD is the snapshot of your last commit
 - Can use git reset HEAD~ to undo the last commit and unstage everything - the equivalent of reversing the git add and git commit commands. 

#### Homework
Create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. For an extra challenge, identify an existing folder and turn into a repository. 

---

### Lesson 3

#### Topic
Developing code on GitHub

#### Objective
Learners will share their local repository on GitHub and learn how to sync some files while ignoring others systematically. Learners will practice developing new code on branches. 

#### Installation & materials

1. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u45oBwInH3HkDE0KbRUFeVK_-P1oP6PA-yjYPbNH7wM/edit#slide=id.p)
2. [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git episode #6](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/06-ignore/index.html)
3. GitHub authentication with PAT using [Jenny Bryan's Git book chapter 9](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html) or with ssh using [Software Carpentry Version Control #7, section 3](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/07-github/index.html#3-ssh-background-and-setup)

5. [Software Carpentry branching add-on](http://erdavenport.github.io/git-lessons/10-branching.html)

##### Review
If anyone turned a folder into a repository, share how that went. Ask students to navigate to previous repository, add new R file, and practice an add-commit cycle. 

##### Modifications
 - Provide a large .csv file, ask students to move into pilot-analyses repo within a data folder using cd and filepaths
 - Use RStudio interface to create a new text file, save as .gitignore; explore how to suppress a specific file, files within a folder, and specific kinds of file extensions
 - Start remotes section with SSH setup, one of two options: 
    1. SSH method. More difficult to explain and set up, but doesn't expire and applies to all repos. 
    2. PAT method. Easier to set up, but requires additional R packages and is recommended to set to expire. 
 - Proceed to connecting local repository to GitHub repository; GitHub repository must be empty
 - Create new repository entitled `repro-DS-workshop` on GitHub; can include README, license, and .gitignore. Clone locally to wherever course materials are organized
 - Show how checking out a branch literally changes the local files
 
#### Teaching notes
 - Practice another add-commit cycle after creating the .gitignore 
 - If `ssh -T git@github.com` doesn't work, could be an issue with OpenSSH. Try a different ssh flavor:
     - `which -a ssh`
     - Use a non OpenSSH version, e.g., `/usr/bin/ssh -T git@github.com`
 - Introduce the add-commit-push cycle

#### Homework
If Lesson 4 will not be taught, skim [tidyverse R style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). What practice or guideline was new to you?

Otherwise, connect personal repository to GitHub. 

---

### Lesson 4

#### Topic
Collaborating with GitHub

#### Objective
Learners will fork and clone a repository on GitHub and use branches to open pull requests. 

#### Installation & materials

1. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oKZ2VK50_CW90Um_iOJ8D6KEPgvapqYvXBFMlx0_aiw/edit)

3. [Software Carpentry Version Control with Git episode #8](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/08-collab/index.html)

##### Review
If anyone connected a local repository to GitHub, share how that went. Ask students to navigate to previous repository, amend an existing file, and practice an add-commit-push cycle. 

##### Modifications
 - The only part of #8 that was taught was cloning a forked repository. Ask students to fork an instructor-created repository, then clone locally. This will be the repo for downstream files. 
 - Use `git remote add upstream xxxx` to connect repo to upstream. If time permits, demonstrate a pull request (PR).
 - Share [diagram](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/post/git-fork-branch-pull/) of relationships between the remotes (upstream and origin) and local
 - Demonstrate pull requests on GitHub
 - Show how distinct units of work can be separately submitted via branches

#### Teaching notes
 - Have students fork a `cct-datascience` repo as an example of a real research compendium
 - Easy to check on learner progress by looking for who has and hasn't forked repo

#### Homework
Skim [tidyverse R style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html). What practice or guideline was new to you?

Also, explore the upstream `cct-datascience` repo. What practices do you notices that are new or different from your own?

### Lesson 5

#### Topic
Project management and coding best practices

#### Objective
Learners will learn about and practice managing their projects using file structure and RStudio projects, and about current best practices and style guides for R coding. (optional) They will also get more comfortable with version control through learning and doing pull requests and reinforcement of git cycle.

##### Review
If lesson 4 was covered, do exercise asking participants to identify who owns the following repos and where they are located, for upstream, origin, and local repos. See example diagram below: 

![](figures/repos_diagram.png)

If lesson 4 was not covered, do the review section in lesson 4. 

##### Modifications
- RStudio
    - Cover only "Introduction to RStudio" section unless learners need a refresher on R
    - Additional keyboard shortcuts from [RStudio's reference list](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts)
- Project management
    - Do "Best practices for project organization" including yellow "Tip: Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing" box
    - Then "A possible solution" section about R projects
    - Include splitting scripts up into modular chunks to promote reproducibility and avoiding rerunning time-intensive data cleaning
- Coding best practices
    - Condensed into a [single slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WNNHQtzq2IUMA0RPz9pwgDCTMLzMIxqQhQsTuR0m_BY/edit#slide=id.geda00d7b2c_0_0)

#### Teaching notes
- After introducing concept of research compendiums, walk through turning their local copy of forked repo into an R project
- To practice git, add and commit new `*.Rproj`, then push to remote repo
- Include how R projects promotes reproducibility, by being able to save scripts and close them or entire project
- Test code in forked cct-datascience repo; are the scripts reproducible? Which characteristics contribute (or not) to its reproducibility?
- If lesson 4 was skipped, add, commit, push these changes and then walk through [opening a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the upstream (instructor's) repo
    - This is another nice way to keep track of learners' progress

#### Homework
Apply one or more of the organizing principles of a research compendium to an existing research project.

### Lesson 6

#### Topic
Intermediate R programming I

#### Objective
Learners will learn how to make their R code more reproducible using functions and control flow approaches.

2. [Data Carpentry for Biologists functions lecture](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/materials/functions-R/)
3. [Data Carpentry for Biologists conditionals lecture](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/materials/conditionals-R/)

##### Review
Ask to share cleaning up of example script, their own script, or their research project folder from lesson 5. 

##### Modifications
- For functions lecture, had them do only the "Use and Modify" exercise
- From conditionals lecture, only did "if statements" section
- From latter, only did "Basic If Statements" #2 exercise
- Added on brief explanation of `ifelse`, using the example of `ifelse(length == 5, "correct", "incorrect")`
- Mention `case_when` from dplyr for more complicated if & else steps

#### Teaching notes
- Before doing functions and conditions, demonstrate updating local `cct-organization` repo from upstream after adding a commit to the upstream
- Create new R script for functions content, and another new R script for control flow (ifelse and for loops) content. Put both scripts into `repro-DS-workshop` repo
- Mention functions are often used with for loops or apply statements
- After functions, mention consistent order of sections in scripts; example is libraries, read in data, functions, executing functions
- Include real world examples of `if` and `ifelse` statements to motivate their use, especially for checking if files already exist
- Demonstrate making a new branch and opening up a pull request in their `repro-DS-workshop` repo at the end of each set of material; can merge pull request

#### Homework
Create a plan for applying these skills to their own research projects. Can apply different parts to different projects, or more integratively to one single project. Some possibilities: 

- Turn the project folder for one of your current research project into a git/GitHub repo and/or R project
- Modify an R script to use functions, if/for loops, or format code according to best practices
- Improve file and folder organization for project or your entire computer!

### Lesson 7

#### Topic
Intermediate R programming II

#### Objective
Learners will learn how to make their R code more reproducible using for loops and the apply family of functions.  

#### Installation & materials

3. [Data Carpentry for Biologists iteration without loops lecture](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/materials/iteration-without-loops-R/)? 

#### Review
Can share their plans for apply skills to their research. Lead optional discussion on when to use base R vs. tidyverse packages/functions. 

##### Modifications
- For for loops lecture:
    - At "Do Tasks 3-4...", do "Basic For Loop" exercises #2 & #3
    - Skip sections "Looping over multiple values" and "Looping with functions"
    - Stop at "Looping over files" due to zip download issues
- For apply lecture: 
    - Do "Size Estimates With Maximum" exercise
    - Do "Size Estimates Vectorized 2" exercise
    - Stop after first section in "Other apply functions (optional)" section

#### Teaching notes
 - Create new R script for these materials. Put script into `repro-DS-workshop` repo
 - Emphasize using for loops using index or non-index methods. Index can be useful for reducing memory use and for storing results
 - If time, demonstrate combining `if` and `for`
 

#### Homework
Identify a script from a research project that could benefit from a for loop, apply, conditional, or function.

### Lesson 8

#### Topic
Data manipulation

#### Objective

Learn how to reproducibly clean, summarize, and reorganize dataframes using tidyverse R packages. 

#### Installation & materials

2. Install R packages 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'readr' and 'udunits2'
3. [Data carpentry R ecology revamp episode #2](https://www.michaelc-m.com/Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson/02-how-r-thinks-about-data.html)
4. [Data carpentry R ecology revamp episode #3](https://www.michaelc-m.com/Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson/03-working-with-data.html)

##### Modifications
 - Explain data.frames and types of vectors, but skip over exercises on coercion and factors
 - Introduce `ud.convert()` as a less error-prone way of performing conversions, compatible within `mutate()`
  - Clarify difference between `==` and `%in%`, including that no warning or error given for `==` that induces vector recycling
  - End with saving script and doing an add-commit-push cycle to sync local repository with GitHub repository

#### Teaching notes
 - Have students install each library separately rather than as the tidyverse - can be important to know which functions come from which packages
 - Encourage use of `ud.convert()` to avoid unit conversion errors
 
#### Homework
None

### Lesson 9

#### Topic
Data visualization

#### Objective
Learners will learn how to build figures using ggplot and practice making multiple plots (for loops, faceting) . 

#### Installation & materials
1. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R4Hs2FRakc8TepFdknJmoS4bxKbBkDR8tS65PYRIKAg/edit#slide=id.p)
2. Install 'ggplot2'
3. [Data Carpentry R ecology lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html) - #4 'Data visualization'

##### Modifications
 - Make a time series plot, but with mean weights across a particular species (`species_id == "DM"`)
     - Reinforce the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions from an earlier lesson
     - Demonstrate piping datasets into `ggplot()`
 - Challenge students to filter by and plot all members of the genus *Dipodomys*; what are some choices for differentiating between species?
     - Students may have used `color = species_id` within `aes()`
     - Show `facet_wrap()` as an option, particularly with `scales = 'free_y'`
 - Additional challenge of adding a third factor of sex (in addition to year and species_id)
     - Show `facet_grid()` as an option, with species by row and sex by column
     - What are the advantages and disadvantages of plotting together versus separately?
 - Final note of caution: it can be important to depict the number of samples that when into the sample mean and sd
     - Can be added with `geom_text()` to the graph itself
     - Or as a color axis when combined with `facet_grid()`

#### Teaching notes
 - Students may be familiar with the basics of ggplot already, this portion of the lesson emphasizes how to build plots and customize viewing options to maximize students' own understanding of their data (as opposed to how to make publication-quality graphs)
 - If 'Intermediate R programming II' was taught, challenge students to create plots of mass over time for each species within a genus using a for loop. Saving out plots with different names will be an extra challenge and require `paste0()`. 
 - Consider replacing data visualization with cleaning and joining data ([Data carpentry R ecology revamp episode #4](https://www.michaelc-m.com/Rewrite-R-ecology-lesson/04-putting-it-together.html)), with more hands on work in three groups. 

#### Homework
For loop for plots of mass over time of each species within a genus.

## Post-lesson followup sessions

It is optional but encouraged to include one or two followup sessions in this workshop series after the lessons focused on content. These can be used to review material, such as the [Jeopardy game](https://jeopardylabs.com/play/data-science-workshop-review-sessions-1-4) that we created. It can be used to cover a small amount of other material, such as this session we did on "Tips for getting your code to work" (see [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T0emX_CyvRH9QDXGzYUq0bwTw2_Oi4PPra_DPYbBeC0/edit#slide=id.p)). And it can be used for attendees to present the work that they've done as demos or "show and tells". 

---

## Technical notes
 - One early problem occurred when students were unsure of which 'Documents' or 'Desktop' folder they were saving to, which made navigating filepaths tricky. Note that on some PCs, the Windows OneDrive backup folders are saved to by default, but students should navigate to `C:/Users/username/Documents` or `C:/Users/username/Desktop`
- R packages sometimes did not install properly. 
    - One reason was that some usernames included special characters, which were not interpreted correctly. 
    - Another included R being installed on a remote server, rather directly on the local machine

## Acknowlegements

Thanks to Teresa Mourad and Fred Abbott of the Ecological Society of America, who invited us to teach the first half of the [Critical Skills to Scale Up Ecology workshop](https://www.esa.org/seeds/meetings/2021-gradstudent-critical-skills-workshop/), which planted the seed for developing this curriculum. We also appreciate the [inaugural class](https://datascience.cals.arizona.edu/spring-2022-workshop-series-reproducibility-and-data-science-skills) of this workshop series at UA in Spring 2022, who inspired deeper conversation about why and how to teach this course. Finally, a huge thanks to [The Carpentries organization](https://carpentries.org/) for generating all of the volunteer-created content we used here, and for training both of us in pedagogy.
