In this workshop you'll gain a better understanding of the "grammar of graphics"---the theory underlying the `ggplot2` package. Using practical examples, you'll learn how understanding the grammar of graphics can help you build more creative, complex, information-rich visualizations.

Source code for the slides can be found at `20230605-foundations-ggplot2/slides.qmd`. Solutions for the code-along exercises are available at `20230605-foundations-ggplot2/plot_layers.R` and `20230605-foundations-ggplot2/plot_facets.R`.
